# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
  steps:
      # 1. Check out the repository so the workflow can access your 'Test' file
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Setup Node.js (Recommended to ensure 'npm' commands work correctly)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # 3. Install Playwright Core (The step you asked for)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install playwright-core

      # 4. Run your script
      # Note: Since your file uses 'import', you may need to rename 'Test' to 'Test.mjs' 
      # or add a package.json with "type": "module" for this to run successfully.
    - name: Run Test Script
        env:
          # This connects the Secret you created in GitHub to the 'process.env' in your code
          BROWSERLESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BROWSERLESS_TOKEN }} 
        run: node Test
